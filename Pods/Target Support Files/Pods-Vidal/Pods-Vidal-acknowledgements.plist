Yandex does not place such records of Visit Sessions on open access and does not provide such records of Visit Sessions to third parties, except for those records the access to which were provided by the User himself.

13. Yandex does not guarantee that the installation of the counter, collection, processing and transmission of this information to Yandex does not violate the legislation of the User?s place of residence. The User performs the installation of the counter and uses the Service at his own risk and is solely responsible for all actions related to the use of the Service, including the installation of a counter, the collection and use of information specified by the User.

14. Yandex has the right without notice and at its sole discretion terminate or suspend the User's access to the Service without explanation, in particular, in case of violation of requirements of this Agreement by such the User.
